What Documents Do You Need to Ship a Car?
Shipping a car, whether for a move, a sale, or relocation, requires careful planning and ensuring that you have all the necessary paperwork in place. Shipping a vehicle might seem like a simple task at first, but to ensure that everything goes smoothly, it’s essential to understand what documents are needed and why they are important. Whether you are shipping your car within the United States or internationally, these documents will help you avoid unnecessary delays, fines, or complications. In this blog post, we will outline the key documents required to ship a car.
1. Vehicle Title (or Proof of Ownership)
One of the most important documents you need when shipping a car is the vehicle title (also known as the certificate of title or proof of ownership). This document proves that you are the legal owner of the vehicle and have the right to ship it.
For cars with an outstanding loan, you may need to provide the lender’s authorization to <a href=https://www.allstatetostateautotransport.com>ship the car</a>. In some cases, the title may not be in your possession if it is held by a financial institution, and you will need to get clearance from them before proceeding.
If you are shipping a car internationally, customs officials in the destination country may require this document to verify ownership and ensure that the vehicle is not stolen. Therefore, make sure you have a clear and unencumbered title if possible.
2. Bill of Sale
A bill of sale is an official document that records the transaction between the buyer and the seller. If you have purchased the car recently or if you are shipping a vehicle that you are selling, you will need a bill of sale. The bill of sale should include key details such as:
The name and contact information of both the buyer and the seller.


A description of the vehicle, including make, model, year, VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), and mileage.


The sale price or the value of the car.


The date of the transaction.


The bill of sale serves as proof that the transaction was legitimate and can be important for customs purposes, particularly if you're shipping internationally.
3. Proof of Insurance
It’s mandatory to have valid vehicle insurance to ship your car. Before the shipping process begins, the shipping company will ask for proof of insurance to ensure the vehicle is covered in case of any damages during transport.

If you already have car insurance, contact your insurance company and confirm that it covers the shipping process, or ask for a special shipping insurance policy. This insurance will protect your vehicle during transit, so make sure that the shipping company’s policy and your insurance align.
In some cases, if you don't have car insurance or the policy doesn't cover transportation, the shipping company can offer temporary insurance for the duration of the move.
4. Government-Issued ID
A government-issued ID (such as a driver’s license or passport) is required by car shipping companies to verify your identity. This is essential to confirm that you are the car's legal owner or have the right to ship it.
This document ensures that the shipping company adheres to legal and security regulations, preventing identity fraud or unauthorized shipments. Ensure that the ID is valid and not expired before submitting it to the shipping company.

5. Shipping Authorization Form
In some cases, especially if you cannot be present at the time of shipment, the shipping company may require a shipping authorization form. This form gives someone else permission to drop off, pick up, or manage the vehicle on your behalf.
This is commonly required if the car is being shipped as part of a corporate move or if you are unable to be at the pickup location due to time constraints. The form must include the details of the authorized person, such as their full name and contact information.
6. Vehicle Condition Report
Before the car is shipped, a vehicle condition report will be completed by the shipping company to document the car’s current state. This inspection is crucial because it serves as a record of any existing damage before the car is loaded onto the transport vehicle. It’s vital to be present during the inspection to confirm that the report is accurate.
If you are shipping your car internationally, the vehicle condition report will help with customs and border clearance. This document will be helpful if you need to file a claim for any damage incurred during transit.
7. Customs Documentation (For International Shipments)
If you’re shipping your car internationally, you’ll need to comply with the customs regulations of the destination country. The required documents may vary based on the country of origin and the destination, but generally, these include:
Import/export declaration forms: These forms are used to declare the car to customs officials, stating that the vehicle will cross international borders.


Customs clearance documents: These may include the invoice, proof of sale, and vehicle title to prove the legitimacy of the shipment.


Emission standards and safety certifications: Many countries require proof that the vehicle meets local environmental and safety regulations.


These documents are essential for ensuring that your car will not be delayed or held up at customs.
8. Odometer Disclosure Statement
In some regions, an odometer disclosure statement is required to confirm the car’s mileage at the time of shipment. This is particularly important for sales or international shipping, where vehicle mileage may need to be verified. This statement helps to prevent fraud related to rolling back odometers and is often a requirement by law for cars being sold or exported.
